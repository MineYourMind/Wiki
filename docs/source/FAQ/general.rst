Where do I apply to become part of the MyM Team?
------------------------------------------------

All information about applying to staff (Jr.Moderator) and their responsibilities can be found on `the forums <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/forums/jobs.239/>`_. You can also apply for Developer here as well.


When do I get promoted from Lost Soul etc.?
-------------------------------------------

The ranks are titles only and nothing more. There is more planned but on a pretty low priority. The promotion itself happens based on your time spent on the server. If you want to know your tracked time, try ``/stats`` in-game. You can view how long it takes to get to each rank `here <http://mym.li/titles>`__.


Is there a TeamSpeak server?
----------------------------

Of course, please use the command ``/ts`` on any of our servers for the details.
There is a ``Verified`` rank on Teamspeak but this doesn't restrict you. This informs us you have verified you Minecraft account with Teamspeak. Nothing more.

Is there a Discord server?

We do now! You can get to the MyM discord by accepting `this <https://discord.gg/8tyM6xb>`__ invite.

Can I record YouTube or Twitch on here?
---------------------------------------

We don't have anything against it, but you better have good endurance as we can not guarantee a constant stability of the server/modpack.


Do I get a special rank if I'm a Streamer/Youtuber?
---------------------------------------------------

Currently, we don't have any special ranks in place.


Do staff get paid for working for MyM?
--------------------------------------

All our staff is working voluntarily without a benefit. No payment, no special permissions for personal use, So be grateful for all the work they do for the community.


Are you guys (staff) playing legit, or use creative for own sake?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Staff play 100% legit at all times. Even instant teleportation is not allowed to be used for personal gain. All the extra permissions granted after becoming a part of the staff are only allowed to be used for fulfilling their duties, not for personal advantage. We enforce this strictly and if you are seeing a staff member not playing legit, please report them to us `here <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/forums/complaints-against-players-and-staff.186/>`__.


What is a Standalone server?
----------------------------

How do I create a ticket?
-------------------------

Creating a ticket requires a forum account which you can create `here <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/login/>`__.

Once you have a forums acount, run ``/ticket`` in game and follow the instructions. (Make sure to be at the correct location before you issue the command as your location will be included.)

**Note:** The command only creates a ticket entry. You **must** click the link that pops up in chat and fill it out or else staff will be unable to see it. Alternatively, you can view your ticket by going to `this <https://mineyourmind.net/ticket/ticket/user>`__ page and clicking the empty ticket.
