Applied Energistics
===================

Applied Energistics is a mod that focuses on creating a compact, easily accessible, considerably expandable and extendable storage system called a ME Network. The “ME” in the title stands for “Matter<->Energy” – the premise being that items added to the system are converted into energy and stored in a digital energy form before needing to be used again, whereupon they are converted back into matter. In addition to providing a potentially attractive solution to storage, the storage network can later be expanded to include the capability to craft recipes-on-demand. A comprehensive automation system may also be added, with the capability to interface with nearly any machine, no matter what mod it belongs to, with basically no limit to the amount of machines that can be added.

All recipes can be found in the Too Many Items menu.
