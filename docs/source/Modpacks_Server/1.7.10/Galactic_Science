Galactic Science
================
This pack was created by a fellow MyMer going by the name of caithleen, the pack was created to bring a new type of server to MyM feauring mods that you rarely see used in popular packs by the FTB team and such.

Description
===========
Survivalpack without hunger or mob modification. Your greatest enemies are oxygen supply and power (which results in oxygen supply ...). The reports about the moon having abundant resources to mine turn out wrong, there are only traces which you will have to extract from the dust and stone itself.

The energy is tiered, the more you advance in HQM and the planet systems, the better power supply you can build (up to enormous fission reactors).

Automation is also tiered a bit to the planetary advancement.

The mod resolves around minechem an ex nihilo. Storage options are a bit limited. The purpose is to have new toys that make you think about how to best use and automate them without going the standard route we know from so much 1.6/7 modpacks. Magic is currently not in, it doesnt fits the theme.

Perhaps we will see a mild magic mod like botania come in.
