Watchdog
--------
Our live monitoring system. If a server is getting into trouble it barks. Build for the Amdins, but public to everyone. Each server sends a heartbeat every 20 seconds including live information about its condition.

* ``Heartbeat`` - Last server respond. 
* ``P30/120/300/600`` - Average server performance over the last 30/120/300/600 seconds in percentage. (100% = 20TPS, 50% = 10TPS..)
* ``GC30`` - The garbage dump from the server in the last 30 seconds.
* ``S6/12/24`` - Server sessions over the last 6/12/24 hours. High numbers signalize that the server crashed/froze/restarted a lot.
* ``Uptime`` - How long the server has been up.
* ``Players`` - Amount of players online.
* ``Staff`` - Amount of staff online, hover for details (red = staff with operator permissions). 
* ``StaffSeen`` - Time passed since a staff member has been seen on this server.
* ``Worlds`` - Amount of worlds present (does not mean loaded).
* ``Chunks`` - Amount of chunks loaded across all worlds. <n>/p chunks per player with a 256 total tolerance removed (the overworld spawn is usually loaded).
* ``Entities`` - Amount of entities (Animlas, Monster, Villager, Items on the ground..) loaded across all worlds. <n>/p entities per player with a 128 total tolerance removed (the overworld spawn is usually loaded).
* ``TileEntities`` - Amount of tile entities (Machines, Chests, Cables/Conduits..) loaded across all worlds. <n>/p tile entities per player with a 256 total tolerance removed (the overworld spawn is usually loaded).
