Forum Account Merges
++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
============

Occasionally, players lose access to their Minecraft account, and decide to simply buy a new one. When this happens, the player will not be able to connect the old forum account with the new minecraft account.

=====

**There are two possible remedies for this.**

**The first method is used if you still have access to your previous forum account:**

1. Create a forum support post here[link] titled "Account Merge", requesting the merge.
2. Create a new forum account linked to your NEW Minecraft account.
3. Respond to your support request with the NEW forum account, authorizing the merge.
4. Wait for an Administrator to complete the merge for you.



**The second method is used if you do not have access to your previous forum account:**

1. Create a new forum account linked to your NEW Minecraft account.
2. Create a forum support post here[link] titled "Account Merge", requesting the merge.
3. Once an Administrator responds to your support post, DM them on the forum with either the Email or Date of Birth associated with your old forum account (Do not DM an Administrator before they have responded to your support post).
4. Wait for an Administrator to complete the merge for you.

======

Once the merge is complete, all ranks, kits, etc should be transferred to your new account. Any claim transfers, inventory transfers, etc will need to be requested at this time. Any issues that arise due to the merge can be reported in the same support thread.
