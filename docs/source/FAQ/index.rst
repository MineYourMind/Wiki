Where do I apply for Staff (jr.Moderator)?
-------------------------------------------------

All information about staff applications and their responsibilities can be found on `the forums <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/forums/jobs.239/>`_.


When do I get promoted from Lost Soul etc.?
-------------------------------------------

The ranks are only titles nothing more. It is planned more but on a pretty low priority. The promotion it self happens based on your time spent on the server. If you wanna know your tracked time try ``/stats``. 


What are credits and how do I get them?
---------------------------------------

Credits is our micro payment currency. It can be obtained on `the shop <http://mym.li/shop>`_.


How frequently does the server restart (every x hours)?
-------------------------------------------------------

The frequency depends highly on the modpack. In general we can say:

=========  ==========
Type       Frequency  
=========  ==========
small      12 hours  
medium     8 hours  
big        4 hours   
unstable*  2-3 hours
=========  ==========

`*unstable in terms of leaking cpu, disk io or memory usage`


Is there a teamspeak server?
----------------------------

Of course, please use the command ``/ts`` on any of our servers for the details.
please keep in mind that you will have to verify your identity in game before use


Can I record YouTube or Twitch on here?
---------------------------------------

We don't have anything against it, but you better have good endurance as we can not guarantee a constant stability of the server/modpack.


Do I get a special rank if im a Streamer/Youtuber?
--------------------------------------------------

Currently we don't have any special ranks in place.


What are tokens and how do I get them?
--------------------------------------

You get tokens by voting. For further information use /vote ingame. Once you have tokens, you can change them to Claimblocks, MyMs, chunk loader tickets and random items by using /shop.


What are MyM's, what can I use them for and how do I get them?
--------------------------------------------------------------

MyM is the ingame currency used for the market, player to player trading, buying/selling Claimblocks... You can change tokens into MyM, but you can also make quite a lot from trading with other players.


What are chunk loader tickets, what can I use them for and how do I get them?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chunk loader tickets are used to keep your chunk loaders active. All 1.7. servers introduce online (iron block) and offline (gold block) chunk loaders. The chunk loaders use up a certain amount of chunk loader tickets per minute, dependent on the size of the area you want to keep loaded. You get chunk loader tickets by changing tokens into them in the /shop.


Tokens? MyMs? Tickets? I am confused, do you have more information?
------------------------------------------------------------------

For a more detailed explanation of the different things you can get from voting, please have a look at `this thread <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/threads/figuring-out-the-way-new-voting-tickets-and-tokens-work.13054/>`_.


What protection does this server use?
-------------------------------------

On the general server's we use GriefPrevention due to its ease of use for the player. Other servers with modpacks like agrarian skies or crash landing use worldguard regions created from the skyblock plugin. Both third party protection systems are extended by our custom ProtectEx extension to protect against more modded items. More information about Grief Prevention can be found :ref:`here <ref-griefprevention-tutorial>`


What is the difference between Farmworld and Overworld?" AKA "What does Farmworld mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The overworld (build world) is one of the only world which isn't being reset. All the other worlds might be reset from time to time, so building there is not advisible. The farmworld looks like the overworld with the difference that quarries (which leave huge holes) and turtles are allowed. This world is meant to be taken apart for resource farming. It is being reset from time to time to allow new players to get depleeted resources like bee hives.


When will the farmwold be reset?
--------------------------------

We now have a new system which will automaticly reset all farmworlds on the first of the month. . The reason is that pre generate worlds in order to avoid the world generation eating up server resources and lagging the server. Unfortunately is the pre generation a task which takes days, hence the not so frequent reset.


Are there any warnings prior to the reset?
------------------------------------------

Warnings are given around 5-7 days before with automated ingame announcements. If the reset only affects the End the warning might not be so long ahead due to the nature of the end not containing big/expensive setups and the bigger urge of more frequent resets.


How do I get more Claimblocks?
------------------------------

You can change MyMs and tokens into Claimblocks. You get tokens from voting, which you can then change into Claimblocks (or MyMs) in the ``/shop``. On some servers you can also get MyMs from trading, which you can change then into Claimblocks.


Is there a limit to the amount of Claimblocks you can have?
-----------------------------------------------------------

There is a limit, but you don't really need to worry about it as it is quite high. Should you ever get to the limit open up a support thread on the forums and we will increase it.


Is PvP allowed here?
--------------------

Unless stated otherwise PvP is not allowed. On some servers you can use ``/pvp`` allowing you to toggle PvP.


Is raiding allowed?
-------------------

Please read the rules they state clearly that griefing/raiding isn't allowed in any case, be it protected or unprotected. **Exceptions** are clearly stated within the server internal ``/rules``.


Am I allowed to break graves?
-----------------------------

Griefing is not allowed, be it protected or not. Taking the belongings of another player is griefing. Plese look up the exact definiton of the word `griefing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Griefing>`_ for the full picture.


Can I get a refund for my [Item]?
---------------------------------

Please check out our `Refund Policy <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/threads/refunds-on-lost-items.2722/>`_


Where can I see the banned items?
---------------------------------

A list of banned items is available ingame with the command ``/banneditems``.


Where do I report a bug?
------------------------

Mainly the forums. Depending on the kind of bug either in the public or private section. If it is a dupe bug or containing personal information please use the private one, if not use the public area to which more people have access hence getting an answer is quicker.

 - `Public Support Forum <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/categories/support-forums.155/>`_
 - `Private Support Forum <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/forums/private-bug-reports.189/>`_


Can you remove this claim next to mine?
---------------------------------------

Our rules stated 2 weeks. Once the owner of the claim and possible trusted people have been offline for more than 2 weeks we are happy to remove the claim and restore the region unless it is an awesome build. In case of small unused claims there is no need for the full 2 weeks in activity rule. To request a claim removal use our :ref:`ticket system <ref-ticket>` within the claim.

a new system on all 1.7.10 servers will automaticly regen areas after 14 days of player inactivity


Do staff get payed for working for MyM?
---------------------------------------

All our staff is working voluntarily without a benefit. No payment, no special permissions for personal use.. They play legit as you do. So be greatful for all the work they do.


Are you guys (staff) playing legit, or use creative for own sake?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Even instant teleportation is not allowed to be used for personal gain. All the extra permissions coming with the staff rank are only allowed for staff work, not for personal. We enforce this strict, if you are seeing someone not playing legit `please report <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/forums/complaints-against-players-and-staff.186/>`_.


Can I transfer Claimblocks to a friend?
----------------------------------------

Claimblocks can be transfered by selling those for MyM's at the Shop NPC or via ``/shop`` and transfering those to your friend ``/money send``.


Why is [Modname/Item] banned?
-----------------------------

There is not a single item being banned for no reason. While our banlist might not seem like the smallest be aware that we are a huge network with quite some knowledge about grief potential, performance issues and server crashes. So minimal ban list doesn't directly mean they know what they do as they might not even be aware of the issues of the items. We have quite some experience in pathing mod's to fix server crashes, improve performance and extend the usual griefprotection to a limit and look for all sorts of possibilities before restricting any item. Check out these `Guidelines <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/threads/our-guidelines-for-banning-items.1017/>`_ explaining our decision making about problematic items.

If you have questions about a particular item feel free to open up a `support thread <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/categories/support-forums.155/>`_ on the forums.

.. _ref-ticket:

How do I create a ticket?
----------------------------------------

Create a ticket requires a forum account which you can create `here <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/login/>`_. Once created use ``/ticket`` in game and follow the instructions. (Make sure to be at the correct location befor you issue the command as your locaton will be included.) **Be aware** the command only creates a ticket mask, you need to go to the ticket system and fill it out else no one will see it.
