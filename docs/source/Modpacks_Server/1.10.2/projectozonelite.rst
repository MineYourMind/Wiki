Project Ozone Lite
==================

Concept
-------
This is Project Ozone as light weight as possible with a limit of only 135 mods. Project Ozone Lite is made for computers that wouldn't be able to handle a normal Project Ozone pack. This pack was made with multiplayer and performance in mind. Project Ozone Lite (POL or POLite for short) uses the Better Questing mod, almost every quest is a retrieval task, and all quests should detect no matter if you unlocked the quest or not.
