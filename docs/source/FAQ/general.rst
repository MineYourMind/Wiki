Where do I apply to become part of the MyM Team?
------------------------------------------------

All information about applying to staff (Jr.Moderator) and their responsibilities can be found on `the forums <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/forums/jobs.239/>`_. You can also apply for Developer here as well.


When do I get promoted from Lost Soul etc.?
-------------------------------------------

The ranks are titles only and nothing more. There is more planned but on a pretty low priority. The promotion itself happens based on your time spent on the server. If you want to know your tracked time, try ``/stats`` in-game. You can view how long it takes to get to each rank `here <http://mym.li/titles>`__.


Is there a TeamSpeak server?
----------------------------

Of course, please use the command ``/ts`` on any of our servers for the details.
There is a ``Verified`` rank on Teamspeak but this doesn't restrict you. This informs us you have verified you Minecraft account with Teamspeak. Nothing more.

Is there a Discord server?

We do now! You can get to the MyM discord by accepting `this <https://discord.gg/8tyM6xb>`__ invite.

Can I record YouTube or Twitch on here?
---------------------------------------

We don't have anything against it, but you better have good endurance as we can not guarantee a constant stability of the server/modpack.

---------------------------------------------------

Currently, we don't have any special ranks in place.

All our staff is working voluntarily without a benefit. No payment, no special permissions for personal use, So be grateful for all the work they do for the community.


Are you guys (staff) playing legit, or use creative for own sake?

Staff play 100% legit at all times. Even instant teleportation is not allowed to be used for personal gain. All the extra permissions granted after becoming a part of the staff are only allowed to be used for fulfilling their duties, not for personal advantage. We enforce this strictl and if you are seeing a staff member not playing legit, please report them to us `here <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/forums/complaints-against-players-and-staff.186/>`__.

How do I create a ticket?
-------------------------

Creating a ticket requires a forum account which you can create `here <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/login/>`__.

Once you have a forums acount, run ``/ticket`` in game and follow the instructions. (Make sure to be at the correct location before you issue the command as your location will be included.)

**Note:** The command only creates a ticket entry. You **must** click the link that pops up in chat and fill it out or else staff will be unable to see it. Alternatively, you can view your ticket by going to `this <https://mineyourmind.net/ticket/ticket/user>`__ page and clicking the empty ticket.
