Create a claim
==============

Use your first Chest to create a claim or use a golden shovel and click two corners with it to create your claim. If you use the golden shovel to create a claim then you have to look that the claim is at least 10x10 blocks, else it will not work. Everything in this claim is protected from outsiders.

The glowstone and gold show you the corners which you can hide with a stick if you right click on the outside of your claim or you click on the inside to show them.

Trust a player
==============

To grant someone the permissions to build in your claim you have to use the command ``/trust [Player]`` while you are in your claim. If you run the command in the outside then the player get trusted in all your claims.
It is also possible to revoke the permissions, for this you have to use ``/untrust [Player]``.

Deleting a claim
================

You can delete one claim or all claims. To delete a claim you have to stand in the claim and use the command ``/abandonclaim``, use it again to confirm it. If you want to delete all your claims you need to use the command ``/abandonallclaims`` and use the command again to confirm it.
