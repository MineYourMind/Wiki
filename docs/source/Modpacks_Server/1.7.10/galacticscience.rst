Galactic Science
================

Concept
-------
The nuclear dawn is here. Large powers around the world launched their nuclear arsenals, making the earth a place without future for mankind.

Luckily you have a chance to survive this. Due to the space projects of your uncle Richard you happen to have a space rocket in your backyard and the coordinates of the outpost base on moon. And since im such a great storywriter, thats about it

You can find more info about Galacatic Science over on the website `here <https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/galactic-science>`_
