Acceptable EMC Loops?
+++++++++++++++++++++

The discussion for this topic can be found |here| (Aido please edit link in) for https://mineyourmind.net/forum/threads/emc-loops-dupes-exploits-changed.24020/

As there have been many misconceptions with the definition of what is, and what is not an *exploit* i.e. saying that the covalence dust
is acceptable as you have to use power to craft it, however this is not the case. Due to the recent changes towards how we handle EMC loops
this section will help you define what is, and what is not, an acceptable EMC loop.

Closed Setups and You
=====================

.. note:: ANY SETUPS WITH COVALENCE DUST ARE CONSIDERED A CLOSED SETUP (And are banned)

A closed setup is one that takes an item (in this case, covalence dust) and combines it with another item (in this case, damaged armor) to make the
same items except now with spare EMC. As there is no **process** that happens between these (i.e. a macerator) that takes time, this means that
the same items can be instantly transported back to crafting these items again and creating more emc. What does this mean to us? It means that
the items being transported multiply from tens to hundreds of items (each causing immense lag for the server).

**Does this only include crafters?**

No, any instant crafting setup that does not take power to create (or cost an item) are **not** exempt from this rule. From the discussion
you can see that anything that multiplies on its own also classifies as one. 

Essentially, if there's no **Process** that takes time and energy, or items (For example, growing gold to mix with iron for invar), 
in-between the conversion to the original item, it's a **closed loop**

Acceptable Setups
=================

Finishing off, I will be discussing the "acceptable" emc loops that are allowed to exist on our servers. These include (but are not limited to):

Blaze Powder (Uses power and a *process* to create more emc)
Demonic Steel of the First Magnitude (Uses a furnace, power, and a *process* to create more emc)
Any EMC Farming setups using Magical Crops or similar mods.

**One final point that I would like to bring up from the original post:**
"Keep in mind: Even if you obtain some of the materials from a third party method, (I.E. Growing resources, smelting resources etc.) 
It is still illegal if you use the loop consists of only crafting. An example of this is growing coal to make Red Matter, 
and then using that red matter to do the classic Red Morningstar EMC loop."
