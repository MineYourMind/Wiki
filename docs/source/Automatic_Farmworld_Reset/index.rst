Automatic Farmworld Resets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What are Automatic Farmworld Resets? 
====================================

Automatic Farmworld Resets (AFR) is a system on MineYourMind that completely resets a dimension/world at a given point in time. If we didn't do this, worlds like The End or the Nether would be completely destroyed and/or looted after a certain point the server opened. When we reset it, it becomes an untouched, clean world. 

What type of Farmworld resets are there?
========================================

Currently there are two types of resets on MineYourMind. We have **Weekly** and **Monthly** resets. The time varies for worlds and when they reset by MineYourMind Administrators. Administrators look at the demands of a world/dimension and see how heavly the world is used up in resources. 

When exactly do these resets happen?
====================================

* **Weekly** - Saturday
* **Monthly** - The *1st* of each month

The reset happens on the first restart of that day 
.. note:: The timezone of the server is GMT+1/2 (Winter/Summer)

Which worlds are on the reset list currently? 
=============================================

We have two different lists here. We have a General reset section and a Exemption/Server Specific reset list. General meaning that these worlds/dimensions are, by default, automatically reset.
